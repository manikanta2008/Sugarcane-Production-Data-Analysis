 Sugarcane Production Data Analysis

 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing global sugarcane production data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights related to production, yield, and cultivated area across different countries.

The analysis helps understand how sugarcane production varies region-wise and over time using data analytics techniques.
